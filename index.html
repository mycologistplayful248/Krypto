        <h2>About Krypto</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Krypto the Superdog</strong> is more than just a pet — he’s
            Superman’s best friend and a hero in his own right.
        </p>
        <p>
            Originally from Krypton, Krypto was sent to Earth by Superman’s father,
            Jor-El, as a test subject before baby Kal-El’s rocket was launched. Due
            to a navigation error, Krypto's ship arrived much later — but he
            eventually found his way to young Clark Kent on Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like Superman, Krypto gained powers from Earth’s yellow sun. His
            abilities include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Flight</li>
            <li>Super strength</li>
            <li>Heat vision</li>
            <li>Super hearing</li>
            <li>Super bark</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Krypto is fiercely loyal and often joins Superman to protect Earth. He
            also stars in his own adventures and has teamed up with the
            <em>Legion of Super-Pets</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            With movie appearances and a comic crossover with Marvel’s Jeff the Land
            Shark, Krypto is getting the spotlight he truly deserves.
